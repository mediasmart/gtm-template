# Mediasmart Conversion Tracking

Mediasmart Conversion Tracking

Mediasmart conversion tracking allows tracking conversions on programmatic campaigns that run on mediasmart’s DSP

For accurate tracking, &msxt=%msxt% (or ?msxt=%msxt%) is needed to be added to the click tracker and made transferrable to the landing page

See https://console.mediasmart.io/docs/introduction for more information
